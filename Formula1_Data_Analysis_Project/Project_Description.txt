We'll be doing a project on building a cloud data platform for reporting and doing analysis of the data from Formula 1 motorsport.

In this project, we'll build a data lake in Azure by ingesting Formula 1 race data from an external API.We'll then transform this data as required for reporting
and analysis purposes and make them available in our presentation layer.

We'll then analyze the data for trends using Databricks and create the necessary dashboards.

We'll also make the data available for BI reporting,and I'll demonstrate how to access this data from Power BI.
All of these process will be scheduled and triggered via Azure Data Factory pipelines.

We'll then go through the new and emerging data lakehouse architecture
and convert our solution to create a data lakehouse using Delta Lake.

Along the way, we'll do some interesting analysis on the data to identify the most dominant drivers
and the teams in the history of Formula 1.
